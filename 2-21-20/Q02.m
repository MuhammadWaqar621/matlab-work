A)nthroot 
nthroot( X , N ) returns the real nth root of the elements of X . 
Both X and N must be real scalars or arrays of the same size. 
If an element in X is negative, then the corresponding element in N must be an odd integer

b)
floor rounds a number to the next smaller integer. For complex arguments,
floor rounds the real and the imaginary parts separately. 
For real numbers and exact expressions representing real numbers, floor returns integers. 
For arguments that contain symbolic identifiers, floor returns unevaluated function calls.

C)
Even though all floating-point numbers are rational numbers,
it is sometimes desirable to approximate them by simple rational numbers,
which are fractions whose numerator and denominator are small integers. The rat function attempts to do this.

D)
If X is a matrix, std(X) returns a row vector containing the standard deviation of the elements of each column of X . 
If X is a multidimensional array, 
std(X) is the standard deviation of the elements along the first nonsingleton dimension of X

E)
[a,b] = size(X) returns the size of matrix X in separate variables a and b .
a show the number of rows and b show the number of column in the X
